You can add distributions to the toolbox by creating versions of the relevant files. Once added, they can be tested using the `priorTest`. For example you can test the Gaussian prior\r\n\r\n`>> priorTest('gaussian')`\r\n\r\nThere are several prior models implemented, the mains ones that are being maintained for the latest release are:\r\n\r\n`gaussian  gamma ` These prior models are Gaussian (zero mean with precision 1), gamma (parameterised by a and b).\r\n\r\nPage updated on Fri Apr 17 17:43:23 2009\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
